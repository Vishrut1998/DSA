Do-while loop:

In do while loop one iteration will always be executed. Consider the following example : 
int i = 21;
do{
    cout << i;
    i = i + 1;
} while(i <= 5)

so even if 21 <= 5 statement is false one iteration will still be executed.
In for loop and while loop condition is checked first and then the code is executed.
But in the do while loop the first iteration will always be executed irrespective of the condition provided.
So do while loop is not used that much.
